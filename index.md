# Documenting JSON
## Caveat
- There is no one partiular way of documention JSON
- Write a sentence for describing the each JSON structure and what it represents
- Use tables for elaborating the JSON details like Element (Name), Description, Type, and Notes.

| Element | Description | Type | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
